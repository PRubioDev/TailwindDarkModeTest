## Introduction

Hi, if you are here, probably you are coming from [This blog post](https://www.rubiopi.com/post/tailwind-dark-mode).

This is a simple demo repository to test dark mode in a Next.js project with Tailwind CSS.

For the Sun/Moon Icon I'm using [@heroicons/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@heroicons/react) and [@mantine/prism](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mantine/prism) for the code highlighting.

## Play

Fork this repository, then clone it and install all the dependencies.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:YourGithubAccount/tailwind-dark-mode-test.git
cd tailwind-dark-mode-test
npm install
```

Then, run the development server and see the different behaviours of Tailwind using dark mode:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
